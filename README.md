# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

The solutions are in Janet and OCaml (except for Day 12).

See also [my notes](notes.txt) on Day 8, Day 10 and Day 12.

Janet solutions are run by

```shell
$ janet advXX.janet
```

OCaml solutions are built with

```shell
$ dune build
```

and run by

```shell
$ dune exec ./advXX.exe
```

where `XX` is the number of the problem.
